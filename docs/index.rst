ALEPH was a particle physics experiment installed on the Large Electron-Positron collider (LEP) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva/Switzerland. It was designed to explore the physics predicted by the Standard Model and to search for physics beyond it. ALEPH first measured events in LEP in July 1989. LEP operated at around 91 GeV â€“ the predicted optimum energy for the formation of the Z particle. From 1995 to 2000 the accelerator operated at energies up to 200 GeV, above the threshold for producing pairs of W particles. The data taken, consisted of millions of events recorded by the ALEPH detector,allowed precision tests of the electro-weak Standard Model (SM) to be undertaken. The group here concentrated our analysis efforts mainly in Heavy Flavour (beauty and charm) physics, in searches for the the Higgs boson, the particles postulated to generate particle mass, and for physics beyond the SM, e.g. Supersymmetry, and in W physics.
This application perform the search for the production and non-standard decay of a scalar Higgs boson into four tau leptons through the intermediation of the neutral pseudo-scalars Higgs particle. 
The analysis was conducted by the ALEPH collaboration with the data collected at centre-of-mass energies from 183 to 209 GeV.

Installation
============
Following instructions are meant for science gateway maintainers while generic users can skip this section.
To install the portlet it is enough to install the war file into the application server and then configure several settings into the portlet preferences pane.
Preferences have the form of a set of couples (key,value). Preferences are also grouped accordingly to the service configured. The meaning of each preference key will be described below, grouping them as well:

============
Usage
============
The aleph portlet interfaces presents two panes named: Analize and VMLogin

.. image:: images/pane1.png

Analize
*******
In the Analize section the user can retrieve one of the available experiment file selecting a DOI number, a keyword or listing the whole content. Once obtained the list of the available files, the user can replicate the analysis just selecting the algorithm from a list e pressing the 'Analyze' button

.. image:: images/pane1_1.png

VM Login
********
In this section the user can obtain the access to a Virtual Machine hosting the whole environment in order to extend the analysis introducing new algorithms or new analisys files.
 
.. image:: images/pane2.png

Pressing the 'Start VM' button, a new virtual machine will be started and associated to the user.

.. image:: images/pane2_2.png

Once available the VM, two image buttons representing a console and the VNC logo inside a monitor, allow respectively to connect the VM to an SSH console or into a VNC session from the portal. In any case the information about how to connect the VM will be sent to the suer via email including the necessary credentials.

WARNING for developers
**********************
Aleph portlet represents a new way to develop portlets for science gateways, deprecating the classic template mi-hostname-portlet.
